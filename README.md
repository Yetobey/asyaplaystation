# pspack-flask
pOOBs4 PS4 exploit for v9.0 + automatic gold hen download + deployment
 
 ## About
 
This is just a repacked psOOBs4, as a flask package with the addition of automatic sending of GoldHEN. Some other small changes:

All credit to the team behind pOOBs4

## Setup

1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it, ideally 3.10
2. Install flask `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Exploiting

1. Run app `python3 app.py`. Might need to run as root to bind to port 1337
2. GoldHEN will be downloaded automatically if out of date
3. In the command line the IP address to navigate to will be printed e.g `* Running on http://192.168.1.200:1337/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
4. Navigate to port 1337 on that IP on your PS4
5. Same as psOOBs4
6. GoldHEN should be sent once the server detects success via log messages

## Running in Docker

1. Run `docker build -t pspack-flask .`
2. Run `docker run --name pspack -d -p 1337:1337 pspack-flask`

## Help! It doesn't work on my machine

1. Try again
2. If you're not running 9.00, the exploit won't run. You'll need to modify [the template](https://github.com/mc-17/pspack-flask/blob/main/templates/index.html#L70) to match your version, or just remove the if/endif
